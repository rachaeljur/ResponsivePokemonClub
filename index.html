    <strong>About Us:</strong> Our Pokemon Fan Club is a group of Pokemon
    lovers who meet every Tuesday and Thursday to play Pokemon, trade cards
    and socialise within a like minded community. We meet at a cafe owned by
    Mr.Peter Pika Saur and his wife Alice fondly known as Mrs Pika Saur. His
    name given inspired by his parents love for Pikachu and Bulbasaur and
    Japanese heritage. For years they have met lots of Pokemon lovers over the
    years. The Pika Saurs continue this tradition. The owners run a normal
    successful cafe during the day where Pokemon is encouraged and
    specifically on Tuesdays and Thursdays open the cafe for club purposes
    - 5-9pm. Please read on for further details.

  <div id="flex-container-our-clubs">
    <strong>Our Clubs:</strong> Our clubs run every Tuesday and Thursday at
    Cafe Passion for Pokemon. The fun sessions start at 5-8pm where our avid
    club members trade cards, discuss Pokemon, play pokemon cardgames and often
    simple foods and drinks for example, Pikachu style cupcakes, Charmander
    Gingerbread, Bulbasaur biscuits and much more. The club is really fun and
    many attend creating a warm, friendly community spirit. Often friendships
    and bonds are made and other community events occur which, is really
    important in an isolating city like London.
